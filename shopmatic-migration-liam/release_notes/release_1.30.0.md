1. ** P1 â€“ Resync Products Inventory Immediately when Automatic Inventory Sync is switched on **

Jira Ticket : https://myshopmatic.atlassian.net/browse/CSM-890

Description:
Right now, inventory syncs happen once a day. However, there should be a resync of products inventory immediately after the automatic inventory sync is switched on. 
Will need this feature to be prioritised as it affects the migration/integration process done by the ops team 

Solution: When user save account setting, we will check automatic_inventory_sync is enable. If yes, we will dispatch immediately.
